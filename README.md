# Plant Disease Detection using Deep Learning

[Using Deep Learning for Image-Based Plant
Disease Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.03169.pdf)

[Data set](https://github.com/spMohanty/PlantVillage-Dataset)

[Models](https://gitlab.com/Israel777/Plant_Disease_Detection_models)



### Approches for Solving the papers realtime Detection Problem



phase 1 : [implement the paper](https://github.com/IsraelAbebe/plant_disease_experements/tree/master/Plant_Disease_Detection_Benchmark_models) 

phase 2 : do analysis on the paper and identify the type of data problem 

phase 3 : [experement and if possible generate Apprprate data
		  using the data and  train the model again](https://github.com/IsraelAbebe/plant_disease_experements/tree/master/Plant_Disease_Detection_gan_experimants)
